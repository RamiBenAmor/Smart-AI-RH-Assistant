# Smart AI HR Assistant 

This project leverages **AI** to optimize recruitment by automating key tasks such as CV classification, matching with job descriptions, and interview management.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Automatic CV Classification
- Upload CVs and have them automatically classified by professional domains (IT, Finance, HR, etc.).  
- Visualize the distribution of CVs across job categories.

### 2. Job Description (JD)-Based CV Filtering & Matching
- Upload job descriptions (JDs).  
- Upload CVs manually or fetch them automatically from Gmail inbox with filters by job title and date range.  
- Match CVs to JDs with a personalized compatibility score based on skills, experience, and job titles.  
- Analyze CV distribution per job role.  
- View detailed scoring breakdowns per candidate.  
- Generate tailored interview questions using Large Language Models (LLMs).  
- Schedule interviews and send invitations automatically.  
- Send rejection emails automatically to unselected candidates.
- Example of Automated Emails:

🔹 Rejection Email (Software Engineer Position)
Thank you for your interest. Unfortunately, we regret to inform you that your application has not been accepted for the position of Software Engineer. We wish you the best in your future endeavors.
Best regards,

🔹 Accepted Interview Email (Software Engineer Position)
We are pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted for a technical interview for the position of Software Engineer. The interview is scheduled on Sunday 03 August 2025 from 19:15 to 21:15 (Europe/Paris time). Please join the Google Meet using the following link: [meet_link]
Best regards,
### 3. Interview Management
- Monitor scheduled interviews via a dedicated dashboard showing candidate info, interview dates, CVs, and job titles.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Requirements
- The main project runs with **Python 3.10+** globally.  
- The server components (e.g., MCP modules) require **Python 3.13** in a **virtual environment**.

---

### 🔧 Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone this repository and required external modules:

- [mcp-use](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use)  
- [google-workspace-mcp-server](https://github.com/epaproditus/google-workspace-mcp-server)

#### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment for MCP (Python 3.13):

```powershell
cd Smart-AI-RH-Assistant\functions\mcp-use
.\mcp_env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Once activated:

```powershell
cd  Smart-AI-RH-Assistant\functions
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

#### 3. In a separate terminal, launch the frontend (Python 3.10):

```powershell
cd Smart-AI-RH-Assistant
streamlit run app.py
```

> ✅ Make sure to configure Gmail access and API keys if email fetching is used.

### 🔧 Modifications to `google-workspace-mcp-server`

I made a modification to the `get-refresh-token.js` file of the [google-workspace-mcp-server] project.  
Specifically, I added the following scope:

'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly'
-📌 Reason:
This scope was added to allow the application to read incoming emails, enabling the automatic detection of new job applications via Gmail.


## 📎 Demo

A  demo video of the platform in action is available.  
All emails shown in the video are invalid and used purely for privacy purposes.
